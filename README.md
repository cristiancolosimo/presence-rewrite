HLCS Presence, rewrited in TS
===============
The presence is a Home automation system for controlling doors electronically and logging accesses.

This is a fork rewrited totaly.
It's javascript free on front-end.
All the front-end is rendered on server side, so you can use it with javascript disabled.
All the logic is rewrited in typescript, so it's more easy to maintain and extend.
It's oriented to security, speed and minimalism.
